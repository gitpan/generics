Revision history for Perl extension generics.

0.04  Wed April 19th 2004
    - Apparently my tests had been breaking, but no emails
      had gotten to me from cpan-testers. I got them today
      and the problem was easily fixed.

0.03  Wed April 18th 2004
    - Pretty much complete reworking of the documentation. 

0.02  Wed April 14th 2004
    - fixed some documentation. The last version of Devel::Cover
	  had an issue with modules that didnt load properly. It has 
	  since been fixed, (currently by a Devel::Cover snapshot 
	  the author sent me, but it should be up soon i would think).
	  
	- Forgot some files in the MANIFEST, so 0.01 probably doesnt
	  install correctly, Duh!

0.01  Mon Apr 12 14:58:17 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-X -n generics
